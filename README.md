A company provided the data of its employees from 1985 to 2013 in 6 CSV files for analysis of employee data with the expectation to create an App for prediction of it's employees attrition

As part of this project, I have designed Entitiy Relationship Diagram, performed Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL server, Python, Created interactive dashboards in powerBI for visualisation and published it on Power BI service and also developed Machine Learning Models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGboost, KNN.

**Logistic Regression is the best model because:**

It has the highest Precision-Recall AUC Score (0.925), which is critical for imbalanced datasets.

It achieves the highest accuracy and cross-validation mean accuracy.

It performs well on both majority and minority classes, with high recall and F1-score for the minority class

Since, Logistic Regression is the best model, I have created an App using this model to predict if an employee/employees will stay in the company or leave the company and deployed it on Render.This App has the following key features: 

Interactive Input: Manual input of any employee or CSV upload for more than one employees

Consistent Preprocessing: Ensures data is processed the same way as during training

Visual Insights: Bar and pie charts for easy interpretation of results.

**Created Python Dashboeard app and deployed it on streamlit cloud.**
This app provides visualiations to give insights on employee and employee attrition data of a company

The App contains Interactive Filters to Explore data dynamically using sidebar filters

Also contains Comprehensive Visuals: 19 visualizations for insights

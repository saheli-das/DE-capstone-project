A company provided the data of its employees from 1985 to 2013 in 6 CSV files for analysis of employee data

As part of this project, I have designed Entitiy Relationship Diagram, performed Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL server, Python and also developed Machine Learning Models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGboost, KNN.

**Logistic Regression is the best model because:**
It has the highest Precision-Recall AUC Score (0.925), which is critical for imbalanced datasets.
It achieves the highest accuracy and cross-validation mean accuracy.
It performs well on both majority and minority classes, with high recall and F1-score for the minority class.

Since, Logistic Regression is the best model, I have created and App for Employee Attrition Prediction using this model and deployed it for which the code is available at Repository named **"emp_status_prediction"**
